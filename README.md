# Welcome to my CV (resumé)

I've created a modern and exportable CV (resumé) using React Router.

## Features

- 🚀 Server-side rendering
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)
- 📄 Exportable CV (resumé) using Puppeteer
- 📦 PNPM to manage dependencies

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t react-cv .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 react-cv
```
